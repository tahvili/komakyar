                    <h2>Collection of non-personal information</h2>
                    <p>When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information that your browser sends.
                        This data may include information such as your device’s IP address, browser type and version,
                        operating system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before

                    <p>You are able to access, add to, update and delete certain Personal Information about you. The
                        information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Website or Services change. When
                        you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our
                        records. Some information may remain in our private records after your deletion of such

                        with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may use any
                        aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or
                        delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period
                        expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
                        erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
                        the expiration of the retention period.</p>
                    <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>

                        our Website; improve customer service and respond to queries and emails of our customers;
                        process transactions; send newsletters; send notification emails such as password reminders,
                        updates, etc; run and operate our Website and Services. Non-Personal Information collected is
                        used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding
                        Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would
                        identify any particular user of the system.</p>
                    <p>We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have
                        given your consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may
                        be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without
                        having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. This, however, does
                        not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European data
                        protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement
                        with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (ii) Processing is necessary for
                        compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a
                        task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested
                        in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or
                        by a third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies
                        to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                        contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
                    <h2>Information transfer and storage</h2>
                    <p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information
                        in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information
                        transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed
                        by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the
                        security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place,
                        you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us
                        using the information provided in the contact section.</p>

                        have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have
                        previously given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to
                        object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis
                        other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us,
                        obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the
                        information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your

                        process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under
                        certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you

                        format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any
                        hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated
                        means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or
                        on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>
                    <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>
                    <p>Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official
                        authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may
                        object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify
                        the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for
                        direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any
                        justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing
                        purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p>
